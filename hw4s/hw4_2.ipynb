It doesn't because it's canceled by the tension forces, which therefore need to be pointing up by at least some amount. If the rope was perfectly horizontal, the tension forces would be perfectly horizontal as well, and hence could not cancel out gravity -- the piece of rope would start moving down, until there is enough of a vertical componenent of tension to cancel out gravity.\n",
